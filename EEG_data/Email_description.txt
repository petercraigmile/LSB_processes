The attached file eeg_F3.txt contains the EEG series plotted in Figure
1.1 of my book. I have EEG series for mored channels for a given
subject so I'll send you those once I refresh my mind on how the data
is formatted (it's been a few years since I have looked at the
original files...). BTW, this is the sub-sampled data but the larger
original +25,000 observations at the 256Hz sampling rate is also
available (not sure if I have this same channel/subject for the raw
data but I have other channels/subjects).
